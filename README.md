I am a data engineer with a professional background in data science and software engineering.

Previously I studied for an undergraduate degree in philosophy, with particular interests in ethics and philosophy of science. 

I am also working on applications to postgraduate degree courses in physics. My current research interests are in quantum computing, quantum information, quantum foundations, and philosophy of physics.
