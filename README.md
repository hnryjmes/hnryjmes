I am currently part-time studying mathematics, computer science, statistical science, and machine learning. My research interests are primarily in artificial intelligence, e.g. automated reasoning, algorithmic game theory, deep reinforcement learning, and natural language understanding. I have been involved in the effective altruism community since 2014, including Giving What We Can and Effective Altruism London.

If you are interested to know about my personality, you can read [this interview I did with Effective Altruism London](https://hnryjmes.substack.com/p/interview-effective-altruism-london), which I think describes me fairly well.
