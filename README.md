I am currently preparing to apply to postgraduate degree courses in mathematics.

My research interests are in pure mathematics, theoretical physics, and theoretical computer science, e.g. algebraic geometry, representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras, quantum field theory, statistical field theory, categorical quantum mechanics, computational learning theory.

I have been involved in the effective altruism community since 2014, including Giving What We Can and Effective Altruism London. I have previously given talks on topics in computer science and AI ethics. I occasionally write blog posts [here](https://hnryjmes.substack.com). I was interviewed by Effective Altruism London in July 2019 which you can read [here](https://hnryjmes.substack.com/p/interview-effective-altruism-london).
