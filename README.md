I am currently preparing to apply to mathematics courses at master's degree level.

My research interests are in the mathematical foundations of computer science and physics, e.g. quantum computation and categorical quantum mechanics. I am also interested in the applications of machine learning and natural language understanding to automated theorem proving.

I have been involved in the effective altruism community since 2014, including Giving What We Can and Effective Altruism London. I have previously given talks on topics in computer science and AI ethics. I occasionally write blog posts [here](https://hnryjmes.substack.com/). I was interviewed by Effective Altruism London in July 2019 which you can read [here](https://hnryjmes.substack.com/p/interview-effective-altruism-london).
