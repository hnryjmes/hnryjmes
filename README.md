I am currently part-time studying mathematics, computer science, statistical science, and machine learning. 

My research interests are primarily in artificial intelligence, e.g. automated reasoning, algorithmic game theory, deep reinforcement learning, and natural language understanding. I have been involved in the effective altruism community since 2014, including Giving What We Can and Effective Altruism London. I have previously given talks on topics in computer science and AI ethics.

I was interviewed by Effective Altruism London in July 2019 which you can read [here](https://hnryjmes.substack.com/p/interview-effective-altruism-london).
