I am a data scientist working in the UK government.

I have been involved in the effective altruism community since 2014, including Giving What We Can and Effective Altruism London. I have previously given talks on topics in computer science and AI ethics. I occasionally write blog posts [here](https://hnryjmes.substack.com/). I was interviewed by Effective Altruism London in July 2019 which you can read [here](https://hnryjmes.substack.com/p/interview-effective-altruism-london).

I am also working on applications to postgraduate degree courses in applied mathematics.

My current research interests are in theoretical computer science (e.g. computational learning theory), quantum physics (e.g. quantum field theory, quantum computation, particle physics), statistical physics (e.g. kinetic theory), relativity and gravitation (e.g. general relativity, cosmology), manifolds and cell complexes (e.g. topological quantum field theory).
