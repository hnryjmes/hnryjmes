I am a data scientist working in the UK government.

I am also working on applications to postgraduate degree courses in applied mathematics.

My current research interests are in theoretical computer science (e.g. computational learning theory), quantum physics (e.g. quantum field theory, quantum computation, particle physics), statistical physics (e.g. kinetic theory), relativity and gravitation (e.g. general relativity, cosmology).
